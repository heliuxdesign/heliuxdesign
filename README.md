Hi!
My name is Heli Järveläinen
I am a Intensive Care Nurse and a Front-End Developer.

I have extensive experience as an intensive care nurse, having worked in this field and in different intensive care wards for several years. I am well-versed in providing critical care to patients with complex medical conditions, ensuring their safety and well-being. I have also gained valuable experience in the field of psychiatry, where I have worked closely with individuals facing mental health challenges, providing them with support and specialized care.

At the moment I am working as a head of a regional project DIPS Arena Pleieplan, and my project conserns the hospitals in the whole Helse Nord region.
I also collaborate with other regions in Norway.
The project involves designing and implementing a new journal system care plan, which aims to streamline documentation processes, enhance communication among healthcare professionals, and improve patient care delivery. In this role, I am responsible for overseeing the project's progress, coordinating with various stakeholders, and ensuring successful implementation across all hospitals within the region.

Education:

1998 Internal disease and surgigal nurse, Helsinki Diakoninstitut
2007 Intensive care nurse, Høgskolen i Tromsø
2023 Front-End Developer, Noroff


Passion for Nursing Informatics:
The intersection of information technology and nursing is an area close to my heart. I firmly believe that leveraging technology can revolutionize healthcare delivery, enhance patient safety, and improve overall efficiency. My background in front-end development and nursing enables me to contribute valuable insights into the design and implementation of technology solutions that address the unique needs of healthcare settings.
