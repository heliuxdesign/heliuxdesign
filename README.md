Hi!
I am Heli Järveläinen, a Intensive Care Nurse and a Front-End Developer from Finland, currently living in Tromsø, Norway.

At the moment I am working as a head of a regional project DIPS Arena Pleieplan, and my project conserns the hospitals in the whole Helse Nord region.
I also collaborate with other regions in Norway.
The project involves designing and implementing a new journal system care plan, which replaces the current morning, evening and nigh shift documents, and treatment plans.

Education:

1998 Internal disease and surgigal nurse, Helsinki Diakoninstitut
2007 Intensive care nurse, Høgskolen i Tromsø
2023 Front-End Developer, Noroff


The intersection of information technology and nursing is an area close to my heart. I firmly believe that leveraging technology can revolutionize healthcare delivery, enhance patient safety, and improve overall efficiency. My background in front-end development and nursing enables me to contribute valuable insights into the design and implementation of technology solutions that address the unique needs of healthcare settings.
